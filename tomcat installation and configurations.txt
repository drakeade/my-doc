        tomcat is a web server we deploy our web apps to tomcat 
to get latest version of tomcat . google : apache tomcat.
use:
   wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.0.27/bin/apache-tomcat-10.0.27.tar.gz
   tar xvfz apache-tomcat-10.0.27.tar.gz (to untar or unzipe tomcat)
   cd apache-tomcat-10.0.27
   ls
   cd conf/
   ls 
   nano tomcat-users.xml  (in this file scroll down to the end just before the closing tag add this three roles
                              is for user creation to be able to accesss all the webapps and war file that download in my tomcat )

    
  tomcat-users.xml -> three roles (and i can change the password or the username if i want)

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<user username="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui, manager-script"/>

./startup.sh
now open tomcat on browser with the test <publicip:8080 0r i can change the port
on tomcat console click on manager app (and it wont give access . to configure access to mager app do the following below

why do we need to configure manager app -> we dont need to restart tomcat and because it makes it easier to see where our .war file is deployed on tomcat -> manager App console.

in test server
use:
cd ..
cd webapps/
ls
cd manager/
ls
cd META-INF

                   in the insert (".*") like this-> allow=".*"/> then manager app will be accessible)
cd ..
